<p>
  People are a kind of animal, but we happen to be smarter than other animals so
  most of the time we pretend we are somehow different from the rest of them.
  We have discovered many things over a long period of time and since a lot of
  these discoveries have been accidental we want to make sure that we don't
  forget them. That is one of the purposes of this book.
</p>
  
  <p>
    Most of the time we use a base-10 numbering system because we have ten fingers.
    Those numbers are:
<ul>
    <li>0 </li>
    <li>1 •</li>
    <li>2 ••</li>
    <li>3 •••</li>
    <li>4 ••••</li>
    <li>5 •••••</li>
    <li>6 ••••••</li>
    <li>7 •••••••</li>
    <li>8 ••••••••</li>
    <li>9 •••••••••</li>
</ul>
  
When we've run out of numbers we ... (uhhhh, how do I describe base systems and decimal points?)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We can describe the measurements of things using numbers and units. The unit of
    length is a meter. A meter is about the distance from the tip of an adult human's
    nose to the tip of their fingers. A more accurate method of obtaining this measurement
    is by ... (Uhhhh, can I find a way to describe this using only physics?)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We live on a sphere of rock called a planet, which we call Earth. Earth
    has a mean radius of 6,371.0088 km. It rotates once a day and because of this
    it's not really a sphere, it bulges in the middle and the equitorial radius is
    6,378.1370 km while the polar radius is 6,356.7523 km. The force that causes
    this is called centrifugal force. The circumference of the Earth at the equator
    is 40,075.017 km and this can be derived from the radius at the equator using
    a magic number called π which is about 3.141592653589793. The circumference is
    2 times π times the radius.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We are held down on earth because of another force called gravity. All things
    have gravity and bigger things have more gravity. Really big things like
    Earth have enough gravity to keep us from falling up. Earth's gravity pulls
    us down at a rate of 9.80665 m/s². Humans also have gravity that pulls other
    things into us but it's so small that we pretend it doesn't exist.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Earth is going around a star that we call the Sun. The Sun is that
    bright yellow thing that appears to rise up from the land in the
    morning and goes back down at night. Stars are spheres of gas
    similar to planets but they are so big that they create energy by
    squeezing together the very tiny pieces of stuff that everything
    is made of. We can see one star during the day, the Sun, and about
    1000 stars at night. However, there are many more stars out there
    too far away for us to see. We think there are about
    1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars out there. Because that's
    a really big number we sometimes write it as 10²⁴ since there are
    24 zeros.
  </p>

  <p>
    Actually, 5 of the things that look like stars in the night sky
    aren't stars, they are other planets. While the rest of the all
    appear to move together through the night, the planets move around
    in different ways. And 9 of the things that look oike stars are
    actually really really big groups of stars called galaxies but
    I'll get to those later.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The Sun looks like it's going up and down or around us in a circle but it's looks
    that way because the Earth is spinning around coming back to the same place once a
    day. A day seems like something that doesn't change but there are really many ways
    to define a day and thus many ways to define time. A day in 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_time">apparent solar time</a> is
    the time it takes for the sun to go from the highest point in the sky on one day to
    the highest point in the sky on the next day. The length of a solar day varies throughout
    the year. This is because the Earth moves faster when it's closer to the sun and slower
    when it's further away and because the earth is tilted when compared to how it moves
    around the sun (I don't actually understand the geometry and math behind this second
    reason). The mean solar day is the average of these and is about 86,400.002 seconds.
    Because the Moon also has a gravitational pull on Earth, Earth's rotation is slowing
    down slowly over time. Therefore, we will need to add about 0.0014 seconds to the mean
    solar day every 100 years. When a day is defined by the apparent location of the other
    stars in the sky then a day is defined as 86,164.098903691 seconds.

    If two people look up at the sky at the exact same time in different parts of the world
    the sun will be in different parts of the sky. Conversely, you can figure out exactly
    where on earth you are by knowing the time and the location of the Sun (or the stars).
    You can measure the passage of time accurately with many different ways. One of the
    easiest ways is by having a certain known amount of sand or water in a vessel with a
    hole in the bottom of it. It will always take the same amount of time for the sand or
    water to completely empty out of the vessel. Another way is to swing something heavy.
    The heavy thing will always take the same amount of time to travel back and forth
    whether it's traveling far at the beginning or a short distance as it loses energy.
    This movement can be used to move a wheel a discrete amount during each swing. This
    is one way to draw a wheel that could be used for this purpose.

    The time it takes the Earth to go around the Sun is a year. This too can be calculated
    in many different ways. The solar year is 365.24217 mean solar days.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The Moon goes around the Earth and the Earth and the other planets go around the Sun.
    This movement is called an orbit and it is caused by gravity. (Ugh, how to I explain orbital mechanics?)
  </p>

  <p>
    The earth weighs about 5,972,370,000,000,000,000,000,000 kg or
    about 6 x 10²⁴. A kg is a unit of weight defined by a cube of
    water with all 3 sides being 0.1 meters in length. An adult person
    weighs about 60 kg. The earth is made up of a solid layer on top
    which we can see but the center is so hot that the rock is melted
    into a liquid, just like ice melts into water. The melted rock is
    mostly made of a material called iron which has an interesting
    property that when it moves it creates energy that we can measure
    and use called magnetism. One interesting feature of this is that
    we can tell which direction is which even when we can't see the
    sun and the stars because another piece of this material will
    always point towards to same place. If you put a small piece of
    this material on some water and move the dish of water around in a
    circle then the piece of material will always point to the same
    place. We call the place it points to north. And right now it's
    very close to the axis of spin that the earth rotates around but
    it won't always be there.

    The galaxies I mentioned above are big groups of stars. All of the
    stars we can see are in our own galaxy. And each of those 9 other
    galaxies we can see have similar numbers of stars in them. We
    think that there are about 100,000,000,000 stars in our galaxy but
    most are so far away that we can't see them. Galaxies are held
    together by gravity, just like we are being held onto the earth
    and the earth is being held close to the sun. We also think there
    are about 2,000,000,000,000,000 other galaxies that we
    theoretically could be able to see. The reason we wouldn't be able
    to see more galaxies further away is because the light from those
    galaxies hasn't had enough time to reach our eyes. This is because
    light takes time to go from one place to another. It seems
    instanteous to us because it's really really fast but between
    objects that are really really far away it takes a potentially very
    long time to travel that distance. Light travels at exactly
    299,792,458 meters per second. It's exact because we've defined
    a meter and a second to fit this number.

    Because the earth is round and curves away from you when you are
    standing on flat ground you can only see about 5 km before the
    earth curves away from you. If you are standing on the tallest
    mountain you can see as far as 370 km. It takes like only 0.0012
    seconds for light to travel that distance. It takes 1.282 seconds
    for light to travel from the moon to the earth and it takes about
    4.643 seconds for light to travel from the sun to the earth. The
    time it takes light to travel from one side of our galaxy to the
    other is about 100,000 years. The time it takes to for light to
    travel from the nearest other galaxy to us is about 2,540,000
    years. Now here's the interesting thing, because the universe is
    about 13,799,000,000 years old, and we can only see stuff with
    light, and light takes time to travel, we can only see out to the
    distance where there has been enough time for light to travel that
    distance. This is about 130,548,619,791,142,459,200,000 km from us
    to the furtherest distance we could thereotically see.

    We think that there are just more galaxies and stars past that
    point. ....
