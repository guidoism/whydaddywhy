  People are a kind of animal, but we happen to be smarter than other animals so
  most of the time we pretend we are somehow different from the rest of them.
  We have discovered many things over a long period of time and since a lot of
  these discoveries have been accidental we want to make sure that we don't
  forget them. That is one of the purposes of this book.

    We live on a sphere of rock called a planet, which we call Earth. Earth
    has a mean radius of 6,371.0088 km. It rotates once a day and because of this
    it's not really a sphere, it bulges in the middle and the equitorial radius is
    6,378.1370 km while the polar radius is 6,356.7523 km. The force that causes
    this is called centrifugal force. The circumference of the Earth at the equator
    is 40,075.017 km and this can be derived from the radius at the equator using
    a magic number called π which is about 3.141592653589793. The circumference is
    2 times π times the radius.

    We are held down on earth because of another force called gravity. All things
    have gravity and bigger things have more gravity. Really big things like
    Earth have enough gravity to keep us from falling up. Earth's gravity pulls
    us down at a rate of 9.80665 m/s². Humans also have gravity that pulls other
    things into us but it's so small that we pretend it doesn't exist.

    Earth is going around a star that we call the Sun. The Sun is that bright yellow
    thing that appears to rise up from the land in the morning and goes back down at
    night. Stars are spheres of gas similar to planets but they are so big that they
    create energy by squeezing together tiny particals.
